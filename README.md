Welcome to my first public GitHub repository!
This project marks the beginning of my journey into version control and collaborative development using Git and GitHub.

Here, I’ll be uploading side projects and experiments I work on in my spare time — fueled by coffee and questionable amounts of curiosity.
It’s all about learning, building, and maybe breaking a few things along the way.

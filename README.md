## 👨‍💻 Author

**Reglaff**  
Learning Python, C++, Rust and the holy trinity of HTML/CSS/JS.  
Building cool things from scratch.  
Also doing 2D/3D mechanical drawings in Autodesk Inventor.  
☕ I write code and drink coffee in equal parts.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- `git init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`
- What a `README.md` is and why it's not optional
- That Git will yell at you if it doesn't know who you are
